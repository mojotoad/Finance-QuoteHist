      quotes though.

1.10  Tue Mar 13 13:57:07 EDT 2007

      Terry Gliedt)

1.09  Thu Jun  8 16:19:57 EDT 2006

      represent volume (thanks to Ivo Welch)

    - Fixed ^DJI test data for quote tests (Yahoo switched to the volume
      for each anchor date rather than aggregate volumes)
    - splits() now returns ref properly in scalar context for
      F::QH::Yahoo. Thanks to Raymond de Leon for spotting.

1.07  Thu Mar 16 00:44:24 EST 2006
    - Internal restructure to date iterators where appropriate.
    - Doc fix for MSN.
    - Various minor edge cases fixed.

1.06  Fri Mar 10 15:59:05 EST 2006
    - Added MSN quote source.
    - Fixed some edge cases involving null-queries on splits.
    - Various minor fixes, including proper business-day calculations
      for end of month dates on montly resolutions, plus proper newline
      stripping (chomp didn't work on MSN csv).

1.05  Tue Feb 28 16:47:57 EST 2006
    - Splits now have no dependencies on dividend queries
    - Daily, Weekly, Monthly granularities available
    - Restored quote_source(), dividend_source(), and
      split_source() methods
    - More tests added

1.04  Fri Jan  6 12:18:59 EST 2006
    - Compensated for yahoo symbol switch from ^DJA to ^DJI, which was
      causing some tests to fail.
    - Updated quotemedia url.

1.03  Wed Nov  2 16:52:30 EST 2005
    - Minor bug fixes
    - Forced date calcs to GMT to avoid some cygwin/win errors
    - Added auto_proxy, enabled during tests so that if $ENV{HTTP_PROXY}
      is present $ua->env_proxy will be automatically invoked
    - Tests will skip if network connectivity cannot be established

1.02  Wed Aug  3 14:46:43 EDT 2005
    - Fixed Date::Manip requirement that was inadvertently dropped.

1.01  Thu Jul 21 13:29:54 EDT 2005
    - Added conditional support for Text::CSV_PP in cases where
      Text::CSV_XS is not installed
    - Split out tests

1.00  Thu Jun 23 16:25:53 EDT 2005
    - Reworked Yahoo! queries for new interface
    - Added quotes from QuoteMedia (they supply SiliconInvestor, so that
      was dropped)
    - Date constraints relaxed. No end date defaults to 'today', no
      start date defaults to inception. Having neither date grabs
      entire history.
    ! Internal API changed from symbolic dereferencing to supplying
      closures and iterators for particular targets and parse modes.

0.33
    - Broke up Yahoo! csv queries into blocks of 1000, as apparently
      Yahoo! sometimes puts a cap on these sort of queries (thanks to
      Jay Strauss)

0.32  Thu Aug 14 13:37:36 EDT 2003
    - Fixed csv parsing for Yahoo dividend data after they fixed
      their format

      rather than 01.

0.28  Thu Feb 28 08:23:08 CST 2002
    - Updated Yahoo interface, incorporating new changes.

      LWP::UserAgent
    - Added WallStreetCity.pm (basic source)

    - Doc cleanup

0.24  Wed Nov 29 02:28:59 CST 2000

    - Fixed cache bug with Yahoo::source_type()
    - Documentation revisions and fixes

0.21  Wed Sep 13 13:25:35 CDT 2000
    - Splits and dividends added
    - Much faster queries, primarily due to taking advantage of Yahoo
      and CSV-formatted data, when available
    - Supports grabbing non-adjusted data, as well as notification when
      transitioning to a site that cannot provide non-adjusted data
    - Supports auto-adjusting of non-adjusted quotes for tables that
      include an adjusted column (like Yahoo in HTML mode)
    - Information pedigree support -- i.e., from which site did the
      quote/split/dividend data come for a particular ticker symbol
    - Revised interface, although the old one is mostly still supported
      (read the docs!)
    - Defunct ticker symbols still supported (quotes only, no
      split/dividend)

0.01  Wed Feb  2 18:24:07 CST 2000
    - Initial version.
